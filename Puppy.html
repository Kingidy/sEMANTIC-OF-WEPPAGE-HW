                <h2> Facts about pups</h2>
                <p>General Information about Puppies:
                Developmental Stages:
                Newborn (0-2 weeks): Puppies are born blind, deaf, and unable to regulate their body temperature. They rely on their
                mother for warmth, food, and cleanliness.
                Transitional Period (2-4 weeks): Puppies start to open their eyes, hear sounds, and grow their first teeth. They begin
                exploring their environment and interacting with their littermates.
                Socialization Period (3-12 weeks): This is a crucial time for puppies to learn social skills. They become more active,
                curious, and begin to play. Early exposure to different environments, people, and animals helps prevent behavioral
                problems later on.
                Juvenile Period (3-6 months): Puppies continue growing rapidly and begin teething, which may lead to chewing behaviors.
                Training should focus on basic commands and social manners.
                Puppy Care:
                Nutrition: Puppies need a diet rich in protein, calcium, and healthy fats to support their growth. Specialized puppy
                food is recommended until they reach maturity.
                Vaccinations: Puppies need vaccinations for common diseases like distemper, parvovirus, and rabies. Vaccinations
                typically begin at 6-8 weeks old and are given in a series.
                Training: Start with basic obedience training, such as sit, stay, and recall. Positive reinforcement, like treats and
                praise, works best for training puppies.
                Exercise: Puppies have short bursts of energy followed by naps. Gentle play and walks are good, but avoid overexertion,
                especially for large breeds to prevent joint problems.  </p>

                <p>Puppy Behavior
                Mouthing and Biting: Puppies naturally explore their world through their mouths. Mouthing or playful biting is common,
                but it’s important to teach them not to bite humans. Providing chew toys and redirecting their biting to appropriate
                items helps.
                Fear Periods: Puppies may go through brief periods where they seem suddenly afraid of new things or even familiar
                environments. This typically happens around 8-11 weeks and again around 6-14 months. It's important not to force them
                into scary situations but to calmly help them through these phases.
                Teething: Puppies will start teething between 3-6 months, and they may chew on furniture, shoes, and just about
                anything. Providing teething toys and gently guiding them away from chewing undesirable items is crucial during this
                time.
                Puppy Play Styles
                Chase Games: Puppies love to chase and be chased, mimicking hunting and play behaviors.
                Tug-of-War: Some puppies enjoy tugging games, but it's important to play this game with rules. Make sure the puppy knows
                a "release" command to prevent aggressive behavior.
                Play Fighting: Play fighting between puppies (or even with humans) is common. They learn bite inhibition this way,
                figuring out how hard is too hard to bite during play. Human play fighting should remain gentle and controlled to avoid
                accidental injuries.
                Health and Grooming
                Spaying/Neutering: It's recommended to spay or neuter your puppy when they’re around 6-9 months old, although the timing
                can vary depending on breed and size. This helps prevent unwanted litters and can have health and behavioral benefits.
                Dental Care: Good oral hygiene starts early. Puppies should get used to having their teeth brushed regularly with
                dog-specific toothpaste to prevent dental diseases later in life.
                Coat Care: Depending on the breed, some puppies will need frequent brushing to prevent matting and shedding. Long-haired
                breeds need regular grooming, while short-haired ones may require less frequent maintenance.
                Puppy Mental Stimulation
                Puzzle Toys and Games: Puppies are naturally curious and intelligent. Puzzle toys or treat-dispensing games can help
                stimulate their minds and provide fun challenges. This can also help prevent boredom, which can lead to destructive
                behavior.
                Training as Stimulation: Short, frequent training sessions are a great way to mentally stimulate puppies. Teaching new
                tricks like "sit," "down," and "stay" not only helps with discipline but keeps their brains active.
                Socialization Dos and Don’ts
                Socialization with People: Puppies should be exposed to different types of people—men, women, children—so they become
                comfortable around them. However, ensure that interactions are positive and not overwhelming.
                Dog Parks: While socializing with other dogs is important, introducing a puppy to a busy dog park too early can be
                overwhelming. It’s best to start with one-on-one playdates with known, vaccinated dogs.
                Environmental Exposure: Let your puppy experience various environments—car rides, different types of floors (carpet,
                tile, grass), and even different sounds (traffic, vacuum cleaners). These help build their confidence in various
                situations.</p>
